                          I graduated with a Master in Business Analytics and currently I am pursing a career in the data science field.<br>
                          I have two years experience in data analytics and I analyze customer and financial data to provide actional insights to the business.
                          As a problem-solver, I love to use the power of data to solve your business problems.</p>
