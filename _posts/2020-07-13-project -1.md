#  Introduction
Instacart operates as a same-day grocery delivery service that allows customers to shop through the company's mobile app or website from selected grocery stores and the order are reviewed and delivered by personal shoppers. With the large customer base, the company collects data of the users' transactions behavior and purchasing history and predicting customer engagement and behavior with the products and grocery stores have a huge impact on Instacart's success.

Instacart publish the anonymized data on customer orders collected over time. The dataset consists 3 million grocery orders for more than 200,000 Instacart users and comes with total of 6 different tables: `orders`,`products`,`order_product_prior`,`order_product_train`,`aisle`,`department`. Data Dictionary could be found at [here](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b).

The main purpose of the project is to perform an exploratory analysis to better understand customer behavior and formulate incremental business problems to increase revenue.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis was divided into 3 parts:
 - Order level Analysis
 - Product level Analysis


For each parts, I will explore the datasets to extract insights to answer business questions.

## Order level Analysis
There are 3,421,083 orders in the `orders` table.

### How does the number of orders by each user distribute?

The amount of orders for each customers are between 4 to 100. Majority of customer had purchased 4 to 10 times.

### In which day of week and time that customers order most?

<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/Project1/2.png"  alt="">

Sunday(0) evenings and Monday(1) mornings are the prime time for orders.

### How often do customer purchase?

<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/Project1/3.png"  alt="">

Looks like customers order once in every week (check the peak at 7 days) or once in a month (peak at 30 days). We could also see smaller peaks at 14, 21 and 28 days (weekly intervals).

## Product level Analysis

There are 3,346,083 unique orders for 49,685 unique products.

### How many products do customer purchase in an order?

<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/Project1/4.png"  alt="">

- Customers mostly purchase 5 items per order.
- Majority of people like to purchase between 3 to 8 items per order.  

### What are the Top 10 best-seller products?

<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/Project1/5.png"  alt="">

Most of them are organic fruits/veggies.

### Do customers always reorder the same previous ordered products?

<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/Project1/6.png"  alt="">

Around 59% of ordered products are previously ordered by customers.

### Which product do customer put into the cart first?

<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/Project1/7.png"  alt="">

Customers seem to be quite certain about Emergency Contraceptive and if they buy them, put them into their cart first in 79% of time.

### Which departments are usually reordered?

<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/Project1/8.png"  alt="">

Personal care has the lowest reorder ratio and dairy eggs have the highest reorder ratio.

### What the relationship between add-to-cart orders and reorder ratio?

<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/Project1/9.png"  alt="">

Looks like the products that are added to the cart initially are more likely to be reordered again compared to the ones added later. This makes sense to me as well since we tend to first order all the products we used to buy frequently and then look out for the new products available.


# Conclusions
In our Instacart analysis, we can summarize possible business problems that might have impact on revenue are:

- Frequency of customer order is comparatively low with the range from 4-10 times.
**What actions can a business take in order to improve the frequency of customer orders?**

- Majority of customers placed orders in a weekly and monthly cycles.
**What actions can a business take to shorten the purchase cycles?**

- The top-sellers are fruits and veggies and customers preferred to order produce goods on the Instacart.
**What actions can a business take to improve other products' sales?**
