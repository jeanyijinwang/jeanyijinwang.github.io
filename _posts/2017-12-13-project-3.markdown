# About the Project
The main goal of this project was to predict the coronary heart disease and identify the important factors that caused the disease.
The evaluation metric was `classification error`.

# Methodology
- Data: From a retrospective sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk region of the Western Cape, South Africa.
- **Logistic regression**:
  - Used P-value to measure the importance of variables.
  - Concluded that the increase in cumulative tobacco usage, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, type-A behavior and age at one set, and the presnet of family history of heart disease will increase the possibility of response coronary heart disease positive.
  - The overall percentage of correct prediction is **74.2%**.
- **Bagging**:
  - Used variable importance measures plot
  - Concluded that the variables low density lipoprotein cholesterol, age at onset and cumulative tobacco usage are more important in determining response, coronary heart disease positive.
  - The overall percentage of correct prediction is **71.4%**.
